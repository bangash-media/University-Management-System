# University-Management-System
The program should contain the following three modes.  1.Teacher Portal           2.University Cafe         3.Gaming Zone 


TEACHER PORTAL
•	In this mode, the program first prompts the users to enter the classes and
subjects. (Suppose the user enters 4 classes, CE-112L MTS II B, CE-112L MTS II-
A, CE-112L BEEP II-A, and CE-115L BEBME II-A)

•	Now the program should ask the user to enter any one of the selected classes,
e.g., Press 1 for CE-112L MTS II B, press 2 for CE-112L MTS II-A, press 3 for CE-
112L BEEP II-A, and press 4 for CE-115L BEBME A

•	Upon choosing any one of the classes the user should be able to add students
names, roll numbers, and marks in each assessment.

•	Provide 5 options, press 1 for Lab performance, press 2 for Lab reports, press
3 for Midterm, press 4 for CEA, and press 5 for Final term.

•	For lab performance and lab reports, further, provide more options so that
users can enter marks of each lab performance and lab report.

•	All this marks entry stage is time taking, so you can read all these details
directly from the CSV file using file handling, or for the sake of the project
demo, you can also keep your array sizes to at least 5. (Do the whole process
for only 5 students). Keep array size generic so you can change the array size
to whatever you chose.

•	Provide an option to assign weights to each assessment type.
•	Provide an option to generate total marks after all the marks for each
•	assessment type are entered.
 
UNIVERSITY CAFÉ 
•	Display the cafe menu (All items along with their prices) 
•	Let the user choose any of the items. Provide an option on whether to show the total bill or buy more items. 
•	If the user enters “buy more items”, display the menu again and let the user choose again. Repeat until the user enters “show bill”. 
•	The program should then display the total bill of all the items user bought. 






GAMING ZONE 
•	The user should be able to play a Tic-Tac-Toe game 
•	Tic-Tac-Toe is a game where two players X and O fill the hash (#) shaped box (consisting of two vertical lines crossing two horizontal lines) with 
their alternate turns. 
•	The player who first fills the box with 3Xs or 3Os in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal manner wins the game. 
•	In some cases, when none of the players succeeds in filling the boxes horizontally, vertically, or diagonally with 3Xs or 3Os, then the game is considered a draw. 
•	Make it a 2-player game. 


NOTE :> If you need my CSV files then ib me :)
